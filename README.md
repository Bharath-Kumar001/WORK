Current Projects
Project: Indicator Control System on ESP32

Description: Developed a GPIO-, UART-, PWM-, and timer-based embedded platform on ESP32 to handle indicator logic.

Features:

Button inputs with debouncing

PWM-based LED brightness control

UART logs for diagnostics

State machine to manage indicator behavior

Tools Used: ESP-IDF, FreeRTOS, Simulink-generated code integration

Sensor Integration Work

Integrated TFLuna LiDAR sensor via I2C on ESP32

Designed robust polling logic and handled I2C timing and data integrity

Focused on low-level driver development with minimal OS involvement

Noteworthy Challenges
Handled an ESC-related hardware failure on ESP32, identified grounding issues, and revised interfacing strategy

Managed limited memory scenarios on ARM7TDMI systems, balancing RTOS overhead and application logic
